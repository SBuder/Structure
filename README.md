## Note(s):
- BestPractise is to avoid such collective repositories (Should actually be split up, due to versioning, reusage, ...)

## Suggestions:
- Create SolutionTemplate

- Coding Conventions / BestPractises
  - 3 classes new namespace (Too much projects)
  - More strict coding styles (Too long line, 2 dot, ...)
  - IFactory / IFacade over gazillion interfaces being injected

- UnitTest conventions
  - Naming (Member_WhatIsTested_ExpectedResult)
  - MutationTesting ?

## ToDo:
- How to deal with features integrating into product code?
